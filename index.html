	<div id="short_intro" class="panel panel-success"><p>Hi! I am a Software Developer based in Vancouver, Canada. I graduated from the University of British Columbia with degrees in Computer Science and Biology. Outside of programming, I spend my spare time tap dancing, running, bouldering and watching musicals.</p></div>

       
   <div id="long_intro" style="display:none">

        <p>I graduated from the University of British Columbia with a Bachelor of Computer Science degree, from the BCS/ICS programing, a second-degree program. My first degree is in Biology where I focused on my studies on botany and genetics </p>
        <p>I have about 3 years of industry experience and primarily work as a web application developer with a focus on backend technologies. I do enjoy dabbling with web design on my own time though with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</p>
        <p>On top of being a Software Developer, I am also a Certifed Scrum Master for my team. I coordinate with our Product Owner and VP of Product Innovation to support my team, facilitate discussions surrounding our Scrum process and help with unblocking any issues.</p>
        <p>I have always had an interest in computing, which stems from my learning HTML at the age of 12 in order to jazz up my Neopets userlookup. This lead to my love for my high school computing classes and interest in providing technological support to the various organizations I was a part of.</p>

   <div id="other_experiences" style="display:none">

        <p>Prior to studying computer science and working in techology, I've worked as a communication assistant where I was responsible for the UI/UX of the website, drafting weekly emails, creating PowerPoint slides and writing blog posts.</p>
        <p>I volunteer with Canada Learning Code regulary where I am a mentor and help teach young students the basics of programming in languages such as Python and Processing.</p>
